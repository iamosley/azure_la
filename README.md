## Intro
This blog reviews the implementation of several Microsoft Azure technologies to (re)create my research methodology for "Language Areas" (LAs), a geodemographic technique for exploring the diversity of neighbours via the langue spoken most often at home. Previous investigations have always used 'desktop' technologies, principally Python and MS SQL Server + Spatial. But now I attempt all of it "in the cloud". Furthermore, I investigated the most cost effective, smaller scale, technology to aid companies that are just getting accustomed to Azure concepts.
